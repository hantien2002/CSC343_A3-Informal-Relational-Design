/* Could not: What constraints from the domain specification could not be 
enforced without assertions or triggers, if any?

Each venue must have at least 10 seat is the constraints could not be 
enforced without assertions or triggers.


Did not: What constraints from the domain specification could have been enforced 
without assertions or triggers, but were not enforced, if any? Why not?

We did not enforce 'Every concert in exactly one venue', we can do it buy 
creating another table,

for example:
CREATE TABLE Performance (
  concert_name varchar(50) PRIMARY KEY,
  venue_id varchar(50) NOT NULL
);

But doing so will cause redundancy, venue_id will be in Performance and Concert. And this 
will cause anomalies. 
Only one of 'enfore a venue can only have one concert at a given time' 
and 'Every concert in exactly one venue' can be enforced without causing redundancy,
we chose the first one, which is a more realistic constraints.

Extra constraints: What additional constraints that we didnâ€™t mention did you 
enforce, if any? 

None

Assumptions: What assumptions did you make? 
All concert in 2022.
